### ðŸ”¹ About Me  
I am currently working at NoboLabs and diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have a strong passion for problem-solving, especially in developing innovative solutions to various technological challenges. Additionally, I actively contribute to the open-source community because I believe that collaboration and knowledge-sharing accelerate innovation. I enjoy building cool projects, whether they are experimental or have real-world impact. If you're interested in discussing Data, AI, or Technology, feel free to askâ€”Iâ€™m always open to sharing insights and learning together. Oh, and a fun fact: I think Iâ€™m funny, though I might be the only one who thinks so! ðŸ˜†ðŸš€
